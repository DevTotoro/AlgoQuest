\section*{Abstract}

This thesis focuses on the creation of a three-dimensional (\acrshort{3d}) virtual world for teaching algorithms, aiming to improve the learning experience through visuali-zation and interactivity. This interactive environment allows students to interact with algorithms in real time, helping them to better understand abstract conce-pts commonly presented in computer science. The thesis presents some interest-ing points from the  theory and methods of teaching algorithms. The potential of \acrshort{3d} virtual worlds for educational purposes is then discussed, including examples of successful applications. This is followed by the analysis and design of the \acrshort{3d} virtual world, describing the technical infrastructure and design decisions, such as the use of the Unity platform and the development of the \acrshort{rest} \acrshort{api} Server for data and statistics management. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the educational tool was carried out through an empirical study, where data was collected from students' use of the \acrshort{3d} virtual world. The results showed that the use of the \acrshort{3d} environment improved the understanding of algorithms and made learning more engaging and interesting.
