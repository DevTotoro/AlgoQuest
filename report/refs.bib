	abstract = {3D virtual worlds ({VWs}) are popular in students activities and an interesting area of research evolving  educational games to demonstrate new learning practices in education.  In our Erasmus+ projects we have developed various educational games in {VWs} (Agrient, Biz4Fun, Avares, {NET}, Entreality) teaching courses in the area of agriculture, physics, business etc . Algorithm teaching, is  a very important subject for our students. It is part of introductory courses and the core content of data structures courses of undergraduate computing courses. Various tools and studies have been proposed to support learning and in depth understanding. 
We propose an approach using 3D Virtual Wolds. The application that is being developed includes a 3D environment using {UNITY}, in which students  will be able to assimilate algorithm concepts. We are currently developing the sorting algorithms part, and more specifically some variations of gameplay styles.

Sorting Gameplay:
At the current stage of development, the application creates a set number of containers with random values in a range that is set by the designer. The player then has the option to move values around from container to container. When the values are generated, the application also calculates the optimal steps that are required in order for the array to be sorted. Once that step is complete, a series of steps in a Quest-like form are generated and the user can follow these in order to complete the sorting operation.

The gameplay is the basis for a set of 3 variations and feedback to the tutor:
-Demonstration: The student is unable to move in the world and simply watches a {NPC}(Non-playable character) follow the steps in order to sort the array. This variation is meant to serve as a tutorial of sorts for each algorithm. The student will be able to watch this as many times as they would like.
-Guided: The student is able to move the values around the containers, again with the purpose of sorting the array of containers in an ascending order. He has to follow the objectives as they are provided to them and can only move values around on the containers that are part of the current step. This makes sure that he doesn't get confused by randomly moving values around and messing up the process.
-Unobstructed: The student is freely able to move around and move and place values around containers as they please. There is no limitation, no forced guidance in place to guide the played in a specific direction. Instead there are 2 metrics that serve to incentivize the user into playing this variation. The user tracks the steps that they have taken since the beginning of the level against the ideal number of steps calculated by the algorithm. On top of this there exists a timer which tracks how much time the user spent on the level. This data will then be placed on a leaderboard where a user can track their progress against other users of the application.

Logging Analytics to support tutor:
During the activity log files will keep track of students actions .
• Time spent in each part of the three variations
• Moves of the values around the containers (Guided part, Unobstructed)
• Achievements –Score-Time spent

The logfiles gathered during the pilot phase  will be analysed in order  for us  to design in later phase  feedback for the student, through {NPCs} and {PAs}. 
The pilot phase, and evaluation of the application is expected to be implemented during 2023.},

💬 Let's learn how to use Unity Lobby to connect our players together before starting the game.
You can create a new Lobby, make it public or private, then players can find it either through a Lobby browser or by inputting a Lobby code.
You can then define whatever data you want for the Lobby and each Player. Things like Game Mode, Map, Teams or for the Player you can have Selected Character, Loadout, Color, etc.
This is a really easy to use tool that you can add to your Multiplayer games to make it easy for players to find one another.
This also easily integrates with Netcode for Game Objects which I've already covered, and Relay which I will cover in the next video.

We used two cloud-based systems to demonstrate the usefulness of our metrics and compare their scalability performance in two cloud platforms: Amazon {EC}2 and Microsoft Azure. Our experimental analysis considers three sets of comparisons: first we compare the same cloud-based software service hosted on two different public cloud platforms; second we compare two different cloud-based software services hosted on the same cloud platform; finally, we compare between the same cloud-based software service hosted on the same cloud platform with two different auto-scaling policies. We note that our technical scalability metrics can be integrated into a previously proposed utility oriented metric of scalability. We discuss the implications of our work.},

Challenges in the learning process are, however, particularly difficult to detect and respond to in educational environments where growing class sizes and the increased use of digital technologies mean that teachers are unable to provide nuanced and personalised feedback and support to help students overcome their difficulties. Individual differences, the specifics of the learning activity, and the difficulty of giving individual feedback in large classes and digital environments all add to the challenge of responding to student difficulties and confusion. In this integrative review, we aim to explore difficulties and resulting emotional responses in learning. We will review the primary principles of cognitive disequilibrium and contrast these principles with work on desirable difficulties, productive failure, impasse driven learning and pure discovery-based learning. We conclude with a theoretical model of the zones of optimal and sub-optimal confusion as a way of conceptualising the parameters of productive and non-productive difficulties experienced by students while they learn.},

	shorttitle = {Virtual Worlds for Learning in Metaverse},
	abstract = {As digital technologies continue to evolve, they offer unprecedented opportunities to transform traditional educational paradigms. Virtual worlds offer a dynamic and immersive platform for fostering sustainability education, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. In these interactive environments, students can engage with complex ecological systems and sustainability challenges in a risk-free setting, allowing for experimentation and exploration that would be impractical or impossible in the real world. This study aims to investigate the application of various types of virtual worlds in educational settings, examine their characteristics and potential, and explore how they foster critical 21st-century skills like critical thinking, creativity, communication, and collaboration. This paper comprehensively explores various types of virtual worlds—Adventure World, Simulation World, Creative World, Role-Playing World, and Collaborative World—assessing their impact on educational processes and outcomes. Adventure Worlds, with narrative-driven quests, engage students in exploratory learning within a story context. Simulation Worlds replicate real-world environments, allowing students to practice and hone practical skills in a risk-free setting. Creative Worlds provide open-ended, sandbox-like environments where innovation and imagination are paramount. Role-Playing Worlds facilitate empathy and perspective-taking through character-driven scenarios, while Collaborative Worlds emphasize teamwork and problem-solving in group projects. The narrative review methodology was adopted for the comprehensive analysis and synthesis of the literature to assess the impact and integration of virtual worlds in education, focusing on identifying trends, challenges, and opportunities within this domain. The evaluation methodology used in this study incorporates a mix of the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving ({TRIZ}), Concept-Knowledge (C-K) theory, Structure-behavior-function ({SBF}) modeling, the Framework for 21st Century Learning (P21), and Universal Design for Learning ({UDL}) to evaluate the characteristics and educational potential of different virtual world types. Findings indicate that virtual worlds effectively support critical thinking, creativity, communication, and collaboration skills, presenting a comprehensive analysis of how these environments can support, supplement, or transform traditional educational models. The main outcome of the study is the comprehensive exploration of various types of virtual worlds—Adventure World, Simulation World, Creative World, Role-Playing World, and Collaborative World—in education, demonstrating their significant potential to enhance learning experiences and outcomes through immersive, interactive environments that foster critical thinking, creativity, communication, and collaboration skills.},

	title = {Using {LAMS} to facilitate an effective synchronous virtual classroom in the teaching of algorithms to undergraduate students},
	abstract = {Modern theories of learning suggest that there is a social dimension to the learning process. However, the majority of traditional students do not participate actively in the actual classroom environment. Transition from f2f learning to blended learning means greater demand for support via synchronous Tutoring Tele-Meetings ({TTM}). In conventional Higher Education in Greece students have physical presence by attending lectures but they do not really have the opportunity to actually involve themselves in the learning process. Virtual classroom is one of the tools that can reduce the sense of isolation by offering more engagement opportunities for both online and traditional students. Keeping everyone engaged in a virtual classroom is a challenge because, unlike a physical classroom, students' body language cannot be read. It is important to provide students with learning activities before, during and after the {TTM} in order to achieve much more than just listening and passive attendance. In this paper we propose a {LAMS} sequence template which we expect to lead us to a pedagogical planner for implementing effective synchronous virtual classroom, and we share the lessons learnt about using {LAMS} to facilitate open education in our university. Organizing synchronous e-learning opportunities for our students is an effective way to increase self-learning with less guidance and support. By using {LAMS} we can properly prepare and monitor our students to enhance their participation in effective {TTM} with which we complement teaching of algorithms to undergraduate students.},

	rights = {Creative Commons Attribution-{ShareAlike} License},
	url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=System_usability_scale&oldid=1222590984},
	abstract = {In systems engineering, the system usability scale ({SUS}) is a simple, ten-item attitude Likert scale giving a global view of subjective assessments of usability. It was developed by John Brooke at Digital Equipment Corporation in the {UK} in 1986 as a tool to be used in usability engineering of electronic office systems.
The usability of a system, as defined by the {ISO} standard {ISO} 9241 Part 11, can be measured only by taking into account the context of use of the system—i.e., who is using the system, what they are using it for, and the environment in which they are using it. Furthermore, measurements of usability have several different aspects:

effectiveness (can users successfully achieve their objectives)
efficiency (how much effort and resource is expended in achieving those objectives)
satisfaction (was the experience satisfactory)
Measures of effectiveness and efficiency are also context specific. Effectiveness in using a system for controlling a continuous industrial process would generally be measured in very different terms to, say, effectiveness in using a text editor. Thus, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to answer the question "is system A more usable than system B", because the measures of effectiveness and efficiency may be very different. However, it can be argued that given a sufficiently high-level definition of subjective assessments of usability, comparisons can be made between systems.
The formula for computing the final {SUS} score requires converting the raw scores, by subtracting 1 from each raw score, then utilizing the following equation:
{SUS} has generally been seen as providing this type of high-level subjective view of usability and is thus often used in carrying out comparisons of usability between systems. Because it yields a single score on a scale of 0–100, it can be used to compare even systems that are outwardly dissimilar. This one-dimensional aspect of the {SUS} is both a benefit and a drawback, because the questionnaire is necessarily quite general.
Recently, Lewis and Sauro suggested a two-factor orthogonal structure, which practitioners may use to score the {SUS} on independent Usability and Learnability dimensions. At the same time, Borsci, Federici and Lauriola by an independent analysis confirm the two factors structure of {SUS}, also showing that those factors (Usability and Learnability) are correlated.
The {SUS} has been widely used in the evaluation of a range of systems. Bangor, Kortum and Miller have used the scale extensively over a ten-year period and have produced normative data that allow {SUS} ratings to be positioned relative to other systems. They propose an extension to {SUS} to provide an adjective rating that correlates with a given score.  Based on a review of hundreds of usability studies, Sauro and Lewis proposed a curved grading scale for mean {SUS} scores.},

The puzzle begins with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the top, thus approximating a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to one of the other rods, obeying the following rules:

Only one disk may be moved at a time.
Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.
With three disks, the puzzle can be solved in seven moves. The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2n − 1, where n is the number of disks.},

It is reported that it outperforms some of the well-known metaheuristics regarding constrained benchmark functions, constrained mechanical design, and continuous non-linear numerical optimization problems. Such a breakthrough has steered us towards investigating the secrets of {TLBO}’s dominance. This paper reports our findings on {TLBO} qualitatively and quantitatively through code-reviews and experiments, respectively. Our findings have revealed three important mistakes regarding {TLBO}: (1) at least one unreported but important step; (2) incorrect formulae on a number of fitness function evaluations; and (3) misconceptions about parameter-less control. Additionally, unfair experimental settings/conditions were used to conduct experimental comparisons (e.g., different stopping criteria). The experimental results for constrained and unconstrained benchmark functions under fairly equal conditions failed to validate its performance supremacy. The ultimate goal of this paper is to provide reminders for metaheuristics’ researchers and practitioners in order to avoid similar mistakes regarding both the qualitative and quantitative aspects, and to allow fair comparisons of the {TLBO} algorithm to be made with other metaheuristic algorithms.},

	shorttitle = {What is a virtual world?},
	abstract = {In 2008, articles by Bell and Schroeder provided an initial platform from which to develop a coherent definition of the term ‘virtual worlds’. Yet over the past ten years, there has been little development of the term. Instead there is confusion in the literature, with the introduction of new terms which are at times used to classify the type of virtual world and at others are used synonymously with the term. At the same time there has been a resurgence of interest in the potential of virtual reality which further muddies the conceptual waters. While the lack of a clear and common understanding of a term is not uncommon, there are implications for researchers and practitioners. To address these issues, this paper presents a new framework for the definition of virtual worlds, arguing what it is for a world to be virtual, the user experience that is a necessary part of this and the technical features which afford this. For the first time the relationships between commonly confused terms and technologies are identified to provide a much needed conceptual clarity for researchers and educators.},

Together with his students from the National University of Singapore, a series of visualizations were developed and consolidated, from simple sorting algorithms to complex graph data structures. Though specifically designed for the use of {NUS} students taking various data structure and algorithm classes ({CS}1010/equivalent, {CS}2040/equivalent, {CS}3230, {CS}3233, and {CS}4234), as advocators of online learning, we hope that curious minds around the world will find these visualizations useful as well.},

In this work, we present an innovative 3D virtual reality educational environment that aims to assist tutors in teaching and students in better learning the search algorithms. The educational environment utilizes innovative educational infrastructure and pedagogical approaches based on visualization of procedures and learning activities that rely on gamification to promote deeper understanding of the challenging concepts of blind and heuristic search algorithms. Algorithm visualization approaches in the virtual environment aim to help students connect abstract concepts and procedures to concrete experiences and examples which promotes robust learning. Learning activities based on the principles of gamification was designed to actively engage students and make learning more entertaining and efficient. The educational environment has been evaluated in real classroom conditions and the evaluation results indicate that the utilization of suitable learning activities in terms of students' active engagement and can motivate students and improve learning efficiency.},

	abstract = {In this paper, first we present an educational system that assists students in learning and tutors in teaching search algorithms, an artificial intelligence topic. Learning is achieved through a wide range of learning activities. Algorithm visualizations demonstrate the operational functionality of algorithms according to the principles of active learning. So, a visualization process can stop and request from a student to specify the next step or explain the way that a decision was made by the algorithm. Similarly, interactive exercises assist students in learning to apply algorithms in a step-by-step interactive way. Students can apply an algorithm to an example case, specifying the algorithm’s steps interactively, with the system’s guidance and help, when necessary. Next, we present assessment approaches integrated in the system that aim to assist tutors in assessing the performance of students, reduce their marking task workload and provide immediate and meaningful feedback to students. Automatic assessment is achieved in four stages, which constitute a general assessment framework. First, the system calculates the similarity between the student’s and the correct answer using the edit distance metric. In the next stage, it identifies the type of the answer, based on an introduced answer categorization scheme related to completeness and accuracy of an answer, taking into account student carelessness too. Afterwards, the types of errors are identified, based on an introduced error categorization scheme. Finally, answer is automatically marked via an automated marker, based on its type, the edit distance and the type of errors made. To assess the learning effectiveness of the system an extended evaluation study was conducted in real class conditions. The experiment showed very encouraging results. Furthermore, to evaluate the performance of the assessment system, we compared the assessment mechanism against expert (human) tutors. A total of 400 students’ answers were assessed by three tutors and the results showed a very good agreement between the automatic assessment system and the tutors.},
